1. (0.98*0.005) = 0.0049   (0.1*0.995)=0.0995
(Positive rate*percentage of sufferers) + (False Positive Rate*percentage of non sufferers)


0.0049+0.0995=0.1044= 10.44%


2. 98% given
3. 90% because the false positive rate is 10%. So correctly identifying a non sufferer means everyone else but the false positives


4.1- [(0.98*0.005)+(0.9*0.995)]= 0.0996 = 9.96% misclassification


Prob of misclassification = 1 - prob of correct classification
